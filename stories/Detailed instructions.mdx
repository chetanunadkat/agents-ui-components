This page will lise detailed description of how to setup agents in various forms.

import { ConfigTable } from "./agents/Setup.stories.jsx";
import { Canvas, Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";

export const sampleDbs = [
  {
    keyName: "Yelp",
    name: "Yelp",
    predefinedQuestions: [
      "Show me any 5 rows from the dataset",
      "Show me any 40 rows from the dataset",
    ],
    isTemp: false,
    sqlOnly: false,
  },
  {
    keyName: "Restaurants",
    name: "Restaurants",
    predefinedQuestions: ["Show me any 5 rows from the dataset"],
    isTemp: false,
    sqlOnly: false,
  },
];

There's three main components you can use as exports from this library. The three components, in increasing level of complexity are:

- `AnalysisAgent`: Renders a single analysis. This requires the least amount of configuration.
- `AnalysisTreeViewer`: A "Tree" of analyses. This requires most of the similar props, but the analyses are now in a tree structure.
- `DefogAnalysisAgentEmbed`: The most complex component, this is a full analysis viewer. It includes the tree, the analysis, and the ability to navigate between datasets. Also allows for CSV uploading and querying that using a sqlite database.

For usage examples, you can follow along this doc, or you can look inside the `test/` folder of this repo.

A crucial component of getting analyses to work is the `Setup` component. This component is a wrapper around your component that will handle the setup of the socket connections for you. You will also be able to pass it all the available options for the agent's configuration.

The agent's configuration controls these options. Some of these are user auth related, others are related to the agent's UI look.

Before you get to running your analysis, you will have a database defined somewhere, and also what you can/cannot allow for that database. For the purpose of these docs, let's say these are our two dbs. This is also the general format all components use for the databases.

The `isTemp` field is used to determine if the database is temporary or not. This is true for CSV databases. If `isTemp` is true, you _must_ pass the `sqliteConn` config option above, pointing to a loca sqlite db (search the docs for functions you can use for this). The `sqlOnly` field is used to determine if the database is only for single step SQL analysis, and not "advanced" aka multi-step agent analysis.

## AnalysisAgent

This is the core analysis component. That renders a single analysis.

For it to work, it needs the following defined:

Here's how you can use it.
