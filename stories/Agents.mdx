There's three main components you can use as exports from this library.

The three components, in increasing level of complexity are:

- `AnalysisAgent`: Renders a single analysis. This requires the least amount of configuration.
- `AnalysisTreeViewer`: A "Tree" of analyses. This requires most of the similar props, but the analyses are now in a tree structure.
- `DefogAnalysisAgentEmbed`: The most complex component, this is a full analysis viewer. It includes the tree, the analysis, and the ability to navigate between datasets. Also allows for CSV uploading and querying that using a sqlite database.

Except when using the last one, you will have to wrap your component inside a context provider called `AgentConfigContext`. This stores the following information:

import { Canvas } from "@storybook/blocks";

import { defaultAgentConfig } from "../lib/agent.ts";

<pre className="text-gray-100 font-mono">
  {JSON.stringify(defaultAgentConfig, null, 2)}
</pre>
